<h3>_______</h3>

<h1>Project One</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/va-nilla-gorilla/CPlusPlus/tree/main/Project1/Project1/src">12hr & 24hr Clock</a>
<h3>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</h3>
<h4>This project addressed the task of creating code to display a 12hr & 24hr clock with the ability to manipulate each time element.</h4>
<h3>What did you do particularly well?</h3>
<h4>I think the part I did exceptionally well was making sure that both clocks mirrored the time correctly and rolled over from 11:59:59PM to 12AM/00AM without any issues. Another part that I feel that I did well on was making the code as minimal as possible.</h4>
<h3>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</h3>
<h4>One idea that I could of made the code better or more secure, would of been to seperate the code in the main function into seperate struct's or classes w/ private class variables. This would then secure that ability to manipulate the time elements, thus making it secure and more alinged with OOP principles.</h4>
<h3>Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?</h3>
<h4>At first, I was a little confused on how to import the time in C++ since it was my first real time coding with C++. After researching different ways of handling time in C++, I started to mess around with different options. I first started to use the chrono methods within C++ and messed around a little with string manipulation, but after realizing that it was way more efficient to use ctime, I decide to go with that route... One site that is a great go-to is www.cplusplus.com & www.stackoverflow.com. Both these sites are great places to research different ways of hanlding a task or problem when coding.</h4>
<h3>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?</h3>
<h4>Every skill that I used in this project was used within every subsequent project. This was my first attempt at using pointers and references within a program and this definitely helped in later projects. </h4>
<h3>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h3>
